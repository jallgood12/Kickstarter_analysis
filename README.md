# Kickstarter_analysis
## Overview of Project
    The purpose of this project is to analyze Louise's data to compare and contrast other plays to her own. We filtered the data based on the target fundraising goal of each play and Theater outcomes based on the date that they launched.
    
## Analysis and Challenges
    I found part one of this challenge very straight foward and only referred to the project outline a few times. However, part two of this challenge posed many problems for me that I was able to overcome through more research. I had a hard time with the COUNTIFS formula and using it to calculate the nember of plays that were successful, failed, and were canceled. Initially I was filtering the goals, outcome, and subcategories then using =COUNTIFS on just the outcome column thinking that it would just count the number of successful plays in the column. I did this for the next cell and got the same answer which stumped me because i thought that all I had to do was change my goal filter. After researching =COUNTIFS via the internet i realized that I needed to include all three column that were being filtered and got the correct answer. 

## Results
    What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date? A: One can conclude that the month of May had the most succeful and failed amount of plays than any other month. Also, you can conclude that there were no cancelations in the month of October.
